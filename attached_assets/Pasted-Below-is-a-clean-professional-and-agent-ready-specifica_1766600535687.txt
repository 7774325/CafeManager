Below is a **clean, professional, and agent-ready specification amendment and instruction set**, fully aligned with your **CKMS Master Specification**, your Loyverse-inspired expectations, and the additional clarification about **credit billing, settlement logic, and inventory behavior**.
This is written so an AI agent or senior developer can clearly understand *exactly* what you want, without confusion, repetition, or ambiguity.

## CKMS – Feature Enhancement & Design Alignment Directive

**(Loyverse-Inspired, Not a Replica)**

### Purpose of This Amendment

This directive enhances the existing **Café & Karaoke Management System (CKMS)** specification. The system is **inspired by the usability and clarity of Loyverse**, but must remain **more advanced, more flexible, and purpose-built**, especially for karaoke room lifecycle management and real-time billing.

This is **not** a clone of Loyverse. CKMS is expected to exceed it in scope, flexibility, and business intelligence.

## 1. UI / UX CONSISTENCY & PROFESSIONAL DESIGN (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Design Standards

* Every page must follow a **single, unified design language**.
* No page should look heavier, bolder, or stylistically unrelated to another.
* Layouts for:

  * Dashboard
  * Billing history
  * Customer profiles
  * Receipts
  * Reports
  * Admin panel
    must feel visually connected and professionally structured.

### Theme Enforcement

* Primary color: **#CCCCFF**
* Secondary: **Black gradient**
* Theme must be applied **globally**, including:

  * Admin panel
  * POS
  * Reports
  * Tablet UI
  * Booking pages
* No partial or mixed themes allowed.

### Navigation Cleanup

* Remove duplicate or misleading navigation items.
* No two links should route to the same page unless intentionally grouped.
* Navigation must reflect clear user intent and role (Admin, Staff, Customer).

### Responsiveness

* Fully responsive on:

  * Mobile
  * Tablet
  * Laptop
  * Desktop
* Admin panel readability is mandatory. Dense or cluttered layouts are unacceptable.

## 2. POS LOGIC – “LOYVERSE+, BUT BETTER”

### Payment & Billing Rules (Very Important)

* **No artificial limits**:

  * Payment methods
  * Number of tables
  * Products
  * Outlets
* Support:

  * Cash
  * Card
  * Wallets
  * Split payments
  * Room + F&B combined bills

### Credit Billing (Key Clarification)

CKMS **must support credit billing**, unlike Loyverse.

**Professional definition of expected behavior:**

* Trusted customers may be allowed to purchase on credit.
* When an item is saved as a **credit sale**:

  * Inventory must be deducted immediately.
  * The sale is recorded as *credited*, not *pending*.
* During **daily shift close / settlement**:

  * There must be **zero pending bills** in the billing screen.
  * Credit sales are treated as *account receivables*, not open transactions.
* Settlement logic:

  * Cash/card totals must reconcile exactly.
  * Credit totals are logged separately for reporting and customer account tracking.
* No unpaid or hanging bills are allowed to block shift closing.

This must be reflected clearly in:

* POS behavior
* Reports
* Inventory movement
* Financial summaries

## 3. KARAOKE & ROOM SYSTEM (CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)

The Karaoke module is a **first-class system**, not an add-on.

### Room Lifecycle (Mandatory)

```
Available → Booked → Active → Cleaning → Available
```

### Tablet Ordering (In-Room)

* Customers can:

  * Browse menu
  * Place kitchen orders
  * See live bill updates
* Bills update in real time using **WebSockets (Django Channels)**.
* Once staff approves orders:

  * Customers immediately see updated totals.

### Session Integrity

* Time-based billing must:

  * Pause / resume
  * Add extra time
  * Sync with POS
* Room charges + F&B must merge seamlessly in billing.

---

## 4. INVENTORY & FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE

### Inventory Rules

* Inventory deducts:

  * On finalized sales
  * On credited sales
* Inventory is **outlet-specific**.
* Cross-outlet transfers must be auditable.

### Reporting

* Real-time Profit & Loss:

  * Revenue (Sales + Room fees)
  * Expenses (Payroll, Utilities, Stock)
* Credit sales must appear clearly in financial reports.
* No ambiguity between paid vs credited revenue.

---

## 5. MULTI-OUTLET & BRANDING SYSTEM

### Independent Outlet Portals

When an admin creates a new outlet:

* They must configure:

  * Outlet name
  * Logo
  * Theme
  * Invoice / receipt branding
  * Public landing page
  * Employee login page
  * Client login page

Each outlet:

* Operates independently
* Has isolated data
* Shares global visibility only with Super Admin

---

## 6. ADMIN EXPERIENCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* Admin panel must be:

  * Clean
  * Readable
  * Logically grouped
* Admin must be able to:

  * Preview public pages
  * Preview tablet UI
  * Preview booking flows
  * Verify branding per outlet
* Nothing should feel hidden or “developer-only”.

---

## 7. CODE QUALITY & DOCUMENTATION

* Every Python, HTML, JS, and WebSocket block must include:

  * Simple, human-readable comments
  * Explanation of purpose and usage
* Especially required for:

  * consumers.py
  * billing logic
  * settlement logic
  * inventory deduction

---

## 8. FOOTER & OWNERSHIP BRANDING

Replace all default credits with:

**“Developed with 💜 ESPECIALLY FOR YOU”**

(Use a purple-blue heart icon in UI, not text)

---

## 9. FINAL EXPECTATION

CKMS must feel like:

* A **modern, enterprise-grade hospitality platform**
* Easy enough for non-technical users
* Powerful enough for owners and auditors
* Visually consistent, calm, and professional

If Loyverse feels *simple*, CKMS should feel *simple but complete*.

### Instruction to the AI Agent

Use this document **together with the original CKMS Master Specification**.
Do not remove existing features.
Refactor, enhance, and align behavior, UI, and logic to match this directive exactly.

If you want next:

* I can turn this into a **gap analysis checklist**
* Or a **developer task breakdown (Sprint-ready)**
* Or a **UI/UX acceptance test document**
