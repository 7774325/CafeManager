## **Master Directive to the AI Agent – Full UI/UX & Functional Re-Architecture**

At this stage, incremental tweaks are no longer acceptable. Although many requested changes were applied, the **Admin panel, landing pages, and overall ergonomics still show minimal visible improvement**. Text readability, color contrast, background fills, and component hierarchy remain weak. The system still feels visually flat, inconsistent, and difficult to scan or use confidently.

This project originated from my own functional foundation. I engaged an AI agent specifically to **elevate it far beyond that baseline**. I now expect a **major, obvious, and transformative change** across the entire platform, both **functionally and in UI/UX quality**.

## **Strategic Reset Required**

Stop incremental patching and perform a **full product-level reassessment**, including:

1. Line-by-line review of every screen, component, and interaction
2. Market and competitor research (POS systems, hospitality SaaS, booking platforms, multi-tenant admin products)
3. Redesign of layouts, spacing, hierarchy, typography, and interactions
4. Simplification of workflows so even non-technical users can operate the system confidently
5. Refactoring UI components into a consistent, reusable design system

## **Product Model Assumption (Mandatory Context)**

Treat this project as a **subscription-based, service-oriented SaaS platform**:

* Each outlet is an **independent business client**
* A **Super Admin (Global Admin)** controls:

  * Outlet creation
  * Feature availability per outlet (Karaoke, HR, CRM, Inventory, etc.)
  * Subscription-based access to modules
* Each outlet independently manages:

  * Employees
  * Products and inventory
  * Rooms and services
  * Branding and portals

The **Admin Panel is the Global Control Center** and must feel powerful, readable, and premium.

## **UI / UX OVERHAUL EXPECTATIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

### **1. Major Visual & Ergonomic Upgrade**

Review every page and component in detail and improve:

* Text readability
* Color contrast
* Background and highlight fills
* Visual balance and spacing

Current issues to eliminate:

* Text blending into backgrounds
* Poorly defined highlight states
* Outdated or uneven widget styling
* Inconsistent font weights and element sizes
* Lack of clear visual rhythm and hierarchy

The result must feel **modern, calm, elegant, and intentionally designed**, not patched or experimental.

---

## **2. Design Consistency & Hierarchy**

* Establish a unified design system covering:

  * Headings, subheadings, body text
  * Cards, tables, widgets
  * Buttons, CTAs, badges, alerts
* Every module (Admin, POS, Booking, Reports, Tablet UI, Landing Pages) must share the same visual language.
* Remove duplicate or confusing navigation paths.

---

## **MANDATORY COLOR THEME**

Design a modern, elegant UI using the following palette:

**Primary**

* Soft Lavender: `#A8AFED`

**Secondary Pastels**

* Light Periwinkle: `#D1D8FF`
* Pale Sky Blue: `#DEE6FC`
* Pastel Aqua: `#ADDCED`

**Neutrals**

* Cream White: `#FFFDF5`
* Ivory Beige: `#F2EFE6`
* Dark Gray: `#333333`
* True Black: `#000000`

**Accent Gradient**

* Purple Blue: `#7D84E4`
* Black: `#000000`

Use the **Purple Blue + Black gradient** in hero sections, banners, CTAs, and modal overlays.

---

## **Counter POS – Product Grid Visual Upgrade**

Redesign the POS product grid to include item images.

Each product tile must display:

* Product image (thumbnail, fast-loading)
* Item name
* Price (MVR)
* Live stock quantity

Rules:

* Clean, touch-friendly layout
* Responsive across POS screens and tablets
* Fallback icon for missing images
* Prioritise images for high-selling and low-stock items

---

## **Right-Side Live Bill Panel – Major Revamp (Loyverse-Inspired)**

Redesign the **live bill panel** to match the clarity and usability standards of Loyverse, while extending functionality.

### **1. Credit Customer Handling Model**

Implement a professional credit billing flow:

* Allow bills to be tagged as **“Credit”**
* Capture:

  * Customer name
  * Optional contact details
* Support **partial payments**
* Display **outstanding balance clearly**
* Include a **“Settle Later”** option with:

  * Due date
  * Notes
* Credit sales must remain visible for reporting but must not block shift settlement

---

### **2. Table Allocation & Visibility**

* Add:

  * Dropdown or quick-select grid for table numbers
* Display the assigned table **clearly and prominently** in the bill panel
* Allow:

  * Filtering bills by table
  * Grouping bills by table
* Table context must be instantly visible to the cashier

---

### **3. Save & Resume Bill Workflow**

Introduce a proper bill holding mechanism:

* Allow cashier to:

  * Save a bill without charging (e.g., **Hold Bill / Pending Bill**)
* Preserve:

  * All items
  * Quantities
  * Notes
* Enable resuming the bill later with one click
* Show:

  * Visual indicators for held bills
  * Time elapsed since the bill was saved

This must support busy environments without data loss or confusion.

---

### **4. Performance & Usability Rules**

* UI must remain:

  * Fast
  * Responsive
  * Mobile- and tablet-friendly
* Prioritise:

  * Clarity
  * Speed
  * Cashier confidence
* No hidden actions or unclear states

---

## **Landing Pages & First Impression**

Landing pages must:

* Instantly communicate professionalism and trust
* Clearly guide users to booking, employee login, and client login
* Compete visually with modern hospitality and SaaS platforms
* Create a strong emotional and visual impact

---

## **Functional Re-Evaluation**

* Revisit workflows for POS, Booking, Billing, Reports, and Admin configuration
* Remove friction, unnecessary steps, and confusing layouts
* Make frequent actions fast and visually obvious

---

## **Expected Outcome**

After this phase:

* The improvement must be **obvious at first glance**
* The platform should feel:

  * More modern
  * More intuitive
  * More premium
  * More competitive
* This should look and behave like a **next-generation SaaS product**, not a refined prototype

Do **not** proceed with minor cosmetic changes.
Treat this as a **full redesign and product refinement phase**, guided by research, UX best practices, and the complete CKMS vision.
